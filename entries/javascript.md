## Features and Capabilities















- **Dynamic**: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning variables do not need to be declared with a specific type. They can hold values of any type and can be reassigned dynamically.







- **Client-side scripting**: JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, allowing developers to enhance the functionality of web pages by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) and responding to user interactions.







- **Event-driven programming**: JavaScript follows an event-driven programming paradigm, where actions or events trigger specific code execution. This allows developers to create interactive and responsive web applications.







- **Wide browser support**: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a versatile language for building web applications that can run on different platforms.



- **Extensibility**: JavaScript can be extended with third-party libraries and frameworks. Popular libraries like jQuery, React, and Vue.js provide additional functionalities and simplify complex tasks.







- **Server-side development**: With the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used for server-side development as well. This enables developers to build full-stack web applications using a single programming language.







- **Web APIs and integration**: JavaScript enables integration with various web APIs, such as geolocation, audio/video, and social media platforms, allowing developers to leverage external services in their applications.
